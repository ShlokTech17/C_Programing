# C Programming Journey

## About Me
Hi, I'm Shlok Chougule, and I started my coding journey with C programming during my first year of engineering. This repository is where I will upload the daily codes and projects I work on as I continue to explore and improve my programming skills.

## What to Expect
- Daily updates with code snippets, programs, and solutions written in C.
- Projects ranging from basic syntax and algorithms to more advanced topics as I progress.
- Clean, well-commented code to help understand the logic behind each program.

## Why C Programming?
C is one of the most fundamental programming languages that provides a solid foundation in programming concepts. It's known for its efficiency and is widely used in systems programming, embedded systems, and applications where performance is critical.

## Contributions and Feedback
Feel free to explore the code, give feedback, or even suggest improvements. I'm always eager to learn and collaborate with others!
